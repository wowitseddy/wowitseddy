orkstation Security Setup (Highlights)

    Choose a Secure OS:

        Use Hardened Arch or Debian for general use (with minimal software installed).

        For highly sensitive tasks, use Tails OS (live OS) or Qubes OS (virtualized environment).

    Minimize Attack Surface:

        Disable unnecessary services and software.

        Use firewall (e.g., ufw, iptables).

        Set up USB lockdown (e.g., usbguard) to prevent unauthorized access.

    System Hardening:

        Enable SELinux or AppArmor for application sandboxing.

        Use Full Disk Encryption (LUKS) for protecting data at rest.

        Apply kernel hardening (e.g., using hardened kernels).

    Isolate Critical Tasks:

        Use containers (e.g., Docker or LXC) for app isolation.

        For extremely sensitive tasks, switch to Tails or Qubes OS for increased privacy.

    Automate Security:

        Set up automatic security updates.

        Use malware/rootkit scanners like rkhunter or chkrootkit for regular checks.

        Implement integrity monitoring (e.g., AIDE).

    USB Device Security:

        Ensure no auto-mounting of USB devices.

        Inspect USB drives for tampered firmware (e.g., BadUSB).

    Network and Authentication:

        Use VPNs and Tor for internet privacy.

        Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible.

        Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity.

    Mental Resilience:

        Balance between security and mental peaceâ€”consider ways to disconnect and recharge in this high-stress situation.
